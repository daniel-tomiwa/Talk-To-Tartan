The course introduces the technical and policy foundations of information security. The main objective of the course is to enable students to reason about information systems from a security engineering perspective, taking into account technical, economic, and policy factors. Some topics covered in the course include elementary cryptography; access control; common software vulnerabilities; common network vulnerabilities; policy and export control laws in the U.S., Japan, and elsewhere; privacy; management and assurance; economics of security; and special topics in information security.","This course primarily aims at providing a level of literacy in information security adequate enough to understand the security implications on a number of diverse domains including software engineering; networking; privacy; and policy.
A secondary objective is to provide a working knowledge of topics such as cryptography, privacy, network security, and infrastructure management so that students can acquire the necessary background for more advanced security courses.","After completing this course, students should be able to reason about systems from the perspective of a security engineer. That is, they should be able to define the system to protect; determine the desired security properties for this system; identify the possible threats to these security properties and their likelihood of occurrence; and consider possible mitigations against these threats.","The course will cover the following topics:

No/low-code For Electronic Business,04-801-O3,Africa,6,Spring,https://www.africa.engineering.cmu.edu/academics/courses/04-801-O3.html,"The coursework includes in-class discussions and a final course project: constructing and implementing a prototype of a no-code/low-code tool for a specific use case in a company. Students will group in teams of 2-3 students. It is essential to begin work on the course project at the start of the course. The students will be divided into teams of 2-3. Every team is required to build a prototype using a no-code/low-code platform for a certain enterprise use case and present their group work during the last meeting of the class.Students will be provided access to a certain widely used no-code/low-code tool (e.g., Tulip). Each team has to make a proposal, which will be discussed in class. Then each team shall construct a prototype using the provided no-code/low-code tool. Aside from the technical realization, business aspects such as business process considerations, process documentation, and others are to be covered. The project and prototype will be presented in the last meeting. No-code/low-code tools enable companies to rapidly build portals, reuse interfaces, and tailor functionality to specific experiences for internal and external users.No-code/low-code platforms provide employees the ability to build applications with an intuitive and easy-to-use design interface. This enables employees to build apps without any extensive programming knowledge (sometimes referred to as “democratize application development”). “Low-code” refers to a modular software development approach that picks and connects blocks of code to build an application. Low-code development platforms are the ones that demand a level of coding but make it extremely easy for the low-code and no-code app builders to develop new apps in the least turnaround time.“No-code” development extends the low-code approach in a way that requires essentially no coding knowledge(usage of drag-and-drop). Applications are assembled with the help of functional, reusable building blocks. Gartner (2019) estimates that low-code app platforms would account for over 65% of development by 2024. Typical advantages of the use of no-code/low-code tools are rapid application development, cost-effectiveness, and enabling new revenue streams and business models. During the course, guidance will be given by the instructor (Prof. Dr. Bernhard Ostheimer, CMU-Africa) and an industry partner as well. Part of the course will be delivered in person at CMU-Africa, and part of the course will be delivered via Zoom.","A structured way of thinking is essential as the students have to analyze an enterprise use case and develop a no-code/low-code-based solution.

Market Planning for High Tech Innovation ,04-612,Africa,12,Spring,https://www.africa.engineering.cmu.edu/academics/courses/04-612.html,"To serve their markets, enterprises develop business plans to articulate their business strategy and operation plans to achieve their goals. Market planning is the process used to develop and manage business plans. More than any other industry, the high-tech industry routinely introduces discontinuous innovations. Market planning in high-tech markets poses its own unique problems due to the market and technological uncertainty and the competitive volatility of high-tech environments. In Africa, many IT-based innovations can be considered High-Tech innovations as they offer solutions whose functioning is beyond the reach of common knowledge and they are discontinuous/radical or disruptive innovations, requiring users to change their mode of behavior or modify products or services they rely on. Due to inappropriate business plans many high-tech innovations never make it successfully to the market. High-tech innovations require a different market planning process for their market introduction. In particular, the Technology Adoption Life-Cycle concept will be used to understand how potential buyers respond to discontinuous innovation. In this course, we will cover the market planning process used for developing a market-driven strategy and business plan for high-tech innovations. The process starts with the understanding of the marketplace that the enterprise decided to serve through market analysis, the segmentation of the marketplace based on the customers’ needs (market segmentation), the selection and prioritization of the market segments (portfolio management), and the development of objectives and strategy for each selected segment (strategic planning). Finally, the tactical actions to implement the strategy are documented in a business plan to ensure the integrated execution of all tactical elements. The course will be illustrated with real examples from the IT industry. Students will apply the concepts learned to develop a business plan for a local enterprise in collaboration with its executive team or for their own innovation.","The primary goal of this course is to provide students with a basic understanding of:
The challenges of market planning for high-tech innovationThe key steps in the development of a business plan
This course objective is not to train market planning experts. Instead, the goal is to introduce students to the market planning concepts to encourage them to further educate themselves in that area. It takes years of practical experience to become a market planning expert.

Recommender Systems,04-800-B,Africa,12,Fall,https://www.africa.engineering.cmu.edu/academics/courses/04-800-B.html,"Information overload is a characteristic of our society today. This has made decision-making more complicated than ever before. For example, choosing which restaurant to go to for the day’s meal is further complicated by a variety of dishes on the same menu. In the entertainment industry, one has to choose whether to read a book or watch a movie and, if so, which one. Recommender systems have come in handy as far as overcoming such challenges is concerned. Recommender systems are now largely used, particularly in eCommerce websites, for easing the information search and discovery processes and increasing customer fidelity and conversion rates. They attempt to guide people into making decisions based on their preferences and personalities and by mimicking the choices of people similar to them.
Recommendation systems are part of machine learning or artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. Students should gain basic knowledge about the field of web recommendation systems and other main recommender systems methods and tools as well as their theoretical foundations. The students will familiarize themselves with the concept of recommender systems and the scientific underpinnings of the latter in different domains.
Students will also gain the necessary tools and techniques to analyze visual and statistical data, build models, and present findings to support data-driven decisions as data science engineers. Students will be involved in hands-on projects such as choosing a topic to work on and getting corresponding data and sources. For example, students can choose from recommender systems in transformer-banking products, healthcare, restaurants, fashion, books, movies, music, and more. For the final project, students will work on RecSys challenges organized by members of the ACM Conference on Recommender Systems. This experience will also give students the skills required for positions in academia and research institutes as well as roles involving network analysis in entrepreneurship and commercial research.","Starting from basic information retrieval concepts, we will investigate basic techniques for information filtering in recommender systems.

Tech Startups: Tools and Techniques,04-616,Africa,12,Spring,https://www.africa.engineering.cmu.edu/academics/courses/04-616.html,"The first three years of a technology start-up, when the company's DNA or trajectory is set, are the most critical. Too few entrepreneurs appreciate this fact and, as a result, many start without the essential skills, talents, and capabilities needed to set the company on a successful path. Some of these entrepreneurial skills can only be learned through starting and growing a business while others can be learned.
This course bridges the challenging gap between learning and doing entrepreneurship. We introduce the essential skill of market discovery, or learning to create, develop, and evaluate the concept of your business. Is my idea a real innovation? Is it also a business or a product, or neither? How do I know how big the market is for my product? What are the technology market and competitive risks in my idea and how do I assess them? Can I compete? Can I sell it? How? When? Where? Students will have the opportunity to apply their newfound practical skills gathered in part from lectures from experienced entrepreneurs and investors to case studies, role-playing, and solving actual problems of local tech businesses.
The best way to learn entrepreneurship is by doing, so the course will use ‘true-to-life’ scenarios. The class will be divided into teams and will focus on a company that is either (1) a student idea for a new start-up, (2) an existing start-up (ideally local), or (3) a hypothetical start-up proposed/conceived by the students, the professor, or both.","Each student will be better able to do the following by the end of the course:

The course will introduce this domain and cover the topics of data centers, virtualization, cloud storage, and programming models. As an introduction, we will discuss the motivating factors, benefits, challenges, and service models. Modern data centers enable many of the economic and technological benefits of the cloud paradigm; hence, we will describe several concepts behind data center design and management. Next, we will focus on virtualization as a key cloud technique for offering software, computation, and storage services. We will study how CPU, memory, and I/O resources are virtualized, with examples from Xen and VMWare, and present real use cases such as Amazon EC2. Subsequently, students will learn about different cloud storage concepts including data distribution, durability, consistency, and redundancy. HDFS, PVFS, HBASE, Cassandra, and S3 will be presented as case studies.

Introduction to Graduate Studies,18-989,Pittsburgh,1,Fall,https://www.africa.engineering.cmu.edu/academics/courses/18-989.html,"The Introduction to Graduate Studies course is designed to increase awareness and understanding of academic integrity issues, Carnegie Mellon community standards, and the ethical job search. This is done via various sessions/modules that are already offered via several entities throughout campus (such as the CPDC, ICC, and GCC). Topics covered include paraphrasing and citation, participating in the US classroom, avoiding plagiarism, unconscious bias, combating sexual violence on campus, finding jobs and internships, negotiation, communication, relationship building, and other topics of interest. The course culminates in students writing a reflection paper. For international students, the paper should compare Western academic and cultural standards to those of their home country. For domestic students, the paper should be a reflection on CMU's community standards. Active participation in 5 sessions/modules in the above-mentioned areas and the submission of the reflection paper will determine a pass/fail grade.
